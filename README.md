# Use `picture` elements

## Exercise

Use `picture` elements for the "expo" images in [src/index.html](src/index.html) (starting with `src="/assets/img/expo-*"`) to load the optimal size and format (`jpg` or `webp`) image.
You can find the scaled images in `jpg` and `webp` format in [src/assets/img/](src/assets/img/).
